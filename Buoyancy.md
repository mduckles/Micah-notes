## Buoyancy

buoyant forces arise from hydrostatic fluid pressure

buoyancy is created by imbalance of [[pressure]]/forces

**weight** of  water **displaced** =  **buoyant force** 
$$ \Sigma F = ma=0$$
$$F_B-w=0$$   

because of this same force is applied to all objects of same shape.

$$p_{out} gV = F_B$$

for the object to rise
$$F_B > W_0 +p_{in}gV$$

$$p_{in}=p_{out}- \frac{w_0}{gV}$$

Air obeys the **ideal gas** equations derived in [[Momentum]]
$$PV=nRT$$
$$\frac{PV}{nT}=R=const.$$

in the example of a hot air balloon V and P are constant while T and n vary so three constants.
$$nT=const.$$
since $$  p \propto n$$
$$ p_{in}T_{in} = p_{out}T_{out}$$

p<sub>out</sub> when a = 0
$$p_{out} = \frac{w_0}{Vg}$$
