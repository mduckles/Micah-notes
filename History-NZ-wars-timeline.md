### Battle of Waikerka
120-100 European troops and 70-150 Maori. Historian James Belich described Waireka as a ‘paper victory’ for the British. He maintained that Kaipopo pā was occupied by one elderly Māori man. The Waitangi Tribunal’s Taranaki report (1996) claimed that Waireka was a Māori victory. Archaeologist and historian Nigel Prickett acknowledged that British reports of ‘cart-loads’ of Māori bodies were exaggerated, but concluded that between 17 and 40 Māori had been killed. Regardless of the body count, the British could claim Waireka as a victory - albeit one of uncertain magnitude.
