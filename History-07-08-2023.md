# What's in a name?
The events we noe collect under the name "The New Zealand Wars" Have had a number of names.
Aside from the regional names [The Wiakato Wars The taranaki Wars etc.]
and namese that assigned reaponsibility (The Maori Wars, Titokawaruis War,Te Kootis War)
a common term, for a while, was The land Wars. While very general, it did acknowledge a fundamental truth. These Wars were, at core, about authority and control over a resource that both Maori and Pakeha held to be of essential importance evne if the reasons varied.
Disputes over ownership of land and resentment over Maori determination to maintain the "undisturbed possession" promited by Te triti become increasingly contentious as the Pakeha population grew

### Battle of Waikerka
120-100 eroupean troops and 70-150 Maori.Historian James Belich described Waireka as a ‘paper victory’ for the British. He maintained that Kaipopo pā was occupied by one elderly Māori man. The Waitangi Tribunal’s Taranaki report (1996) claimed that Waireka was a Māori victory. Archaeologist and historian Nigel Prickett acknowledged that British reports of ‘cart-loads’ of Māori bodies were exaggerated, but concluded that between 17 and 40 Māori had been killed. Regardless of the body count, the British could claim Waireka as a victory - albeit one of uncertain magnitude.
