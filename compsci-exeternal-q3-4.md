## Q1 
With reference to Resources E to G, how do the technical capabilities and limitations of big data affect peopleâ€™s lives? Give examples to support your answer.
# A 

while big data is usefull for making peoples lifes "better" in some ways and does it quite well there are still quite a lot of limitations that have to be taken in to acount and solved. the two major limitations in resource E and G are who the data is coming from and the procesing storing and collecting of data. First who is the data coming from first of all in resourse G it notes that all the data comes from people who have clicked a setting to say that there data can be tracked which means that this is not a random set of people its people who are willing to share that data and even know it's a setting to turn on which means that this excudles people who care about anyominity and privacy and people who don't know that its a setting like people who are very tech savy this means this is a semi small amount of the total population which probably doesn't include lots of older people who don't use technology as well. meaning huge groups of people who it is important for them to stay home might not for all we know because less data would be coming from them. this also aplies to minority groups and having to much.  The second major limitation is the collection and procesing of data. this is because every one that has the setting on will be sending data using data either 4g or 5g probably and while this is great for every persons use google is limited by this speed to collect the data and store it on there systems this can't really be solved in the short term quickly but data transfer speed will get better over time. n
